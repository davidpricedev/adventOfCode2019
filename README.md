Project for learning Kotlin via Advent of Code 2019

Advent of code is a daily coding puzzle around the advent season. See more here: https://adventofcode.com/2019

## Organization

* I've organized the code into one package for each day and one main method per package. 
* I'm not reusing code from one day to the next apart from some utilities and the intcode computer.
* I'm using unit tests for all the examples, but using main() to run the puzzle answers
